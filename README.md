# ARCADE

Will have several fun games that supports several different currencies and credits.
Current Priorities:
BlackJack

## Purpose

The initial purpose of this class is to rebuild the BlackJack game using good OOP practices and SOLID principles.
The classes will be extensible to several other Casino/Arcade games.

Most games will have an Expected Value (EV) calculator that can generate how much currency you will win or lose over time.
Some systems will be much harder to implement than others.

As the focus is BlackJack for now, the program will simulate millions of hands and generate Basic Strategy tables using various counting system techniques.

## Update

ShoeTest now shuffles through an array of cards generated by a rogue clone without throwing error upon exhaustion.
Construction of Card2DAnimation factory now separates red and black cards.

Began to construct BlackJackTable interface along with a class implementation of BlackJackTable_Default. (I know... not on the master goal list this sprint)

Having doubts on Panel Swap class, it may not be relevant if a/the "Previous" IMenu is passed into a constructor. This will allow Anonymous ActionListener classes to implement and clear/reset state along with custom implementation. More to discuss after this.

## Next Master Push Goals

- [ ] Implement interface for back button on the Panel Swap class. (will require careful planning, looking to avoid global references.)
- [x] Clean up some useless functions. Some functions have unused parameters.
- [ ] Overhaul README.md with flow images:
	- [x] Generic library independancy
	- [x] Generic game item diversion independancy
	- [ ] Generic animation diversion independancy

## High level structure.

![Generic Game Structure](readmesrcs/GameSetup.jpg)
The "arcade" package will be treated as a library (will be reusable in different projects).
The "animation" package will be treated as a library (will be reusable in different projects).
The "app" package will utilize the arcade and animation libraries as necessary.
The "debug" package will be destoryed in the future so good practices will not be focused. This will only exist until Test Case library OR separate implementation exists.
