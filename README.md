# ARCADE

Will have several fun games that supports several different currencies and credits.
Current Priorities:
BlackJack

## Purpose

The initial purpose of this class is to rebuild the BlackJack game using good OOP practices and SOLID principles.
The classes will be extensible to several other Casino/Arcade games.

Most games will have an Expected Value (EV) calculator that can generate how much currency you will win or lose over time.
Some systems will be much harder to implement than others.

As the focus is BlackJack for now, the program will simulate millions of hands and generate Basic Strategy tables using various counting system techniques.

## Update

ShoeTest now shuffles through an array of cards generated by a rogue clone without throwing error upon exhaustion.
Construction of Card2DAnimation factory now separates red and black cards.

Back Button implmented but must pass JFrame parent and previous IMenu reference.

## Next Master Push Goals
- [ ] Improve structure diagram. Elaborate more on 2D implementation.
- [ ] Develop Table Interface and Default Table implementation.
- [ ] Verify Shoe interface has everything needed to implement Table simplicity.

## High level structure.

![Generic Game Structure](readmesrcs/GameSetup.jpg)
The "arcade" package will be treated as a library (will be reusable in different projects).
The "animation" package will be treated as a library (will be reusable in different projects).
The "app" package will utilize the arcade and animation libraries as necessary.
The "debug" package will be destoryed in the future so good practices will not be focused. This will only exist until Test Case library OR separate implementation exists.
